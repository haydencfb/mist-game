  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## This project consisted of a RESTful API that needed to be refactored to incorperate GraphQL in order to make these requests at a more industry-standard level. This in mind, this is uses Google's Books API to allow users to create an account, log in and out, and save books to their profiles.

  - My motivation for this project was to become more comforabtle and more understanding of the use and purpose of GraphQL.
  - I built this project because I wanted to further understand GraphQL and the real world use of it. Since I had already become relatively comfortable with the RESTful method, I wanted to understand the reasoning behind making a switch.
  - This project solves the problem of having code that is not up to industry standard, as it lacks the newest capabilities and efficiencies that it could having using updated and renovated methods.
  - I learned more about GraphQL, its use, and what it intends to 'replace' within the coding space.
